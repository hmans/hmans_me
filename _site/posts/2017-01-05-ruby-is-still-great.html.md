I realized something today:

**Ruby is still great.**

I've spent the last couple of weeks digging into some of the newer/fancier/shinier technologies that have been the focus of the development world lately -- specifically Elixir, Phoenix and Elm -- and while I've thoroughly enjoyed them all (and instantly had a bunch of fun ideas for things to build with them), there are still software projects where an interpreted, loosely-typed scripting language like Ruby is the better fit.
