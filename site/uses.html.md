# Stuff I Use

## Operating Systems

- Like many of you, I do pretty much all of my development on **macOS**, currently on a 2012 **13" MacBook Air** that is in desperate need of replacing (I'm waiting for those new MacBook Pros that are coming this fall.) I appreciate macOS' short update cycles and usually work with the latest version available (yes, even the .0 releases -- I like living dangerously.)
- There's also a self-built **Windows 10 PC** living in my office, which I mostly use for gaming (when I find time for it) and testing stuff on Windows.
- Even though I'm impressed by what they can do, I'm not a huge fan of blindly throwing everything at Google's or Amazon's cloud infrastructure offerings, so I usually end up setting my own servers for client projects or my own. I usually do this at **[DomainFactory (formerly JiffyBox)](https://www.df.eu/de/cloud-hosting/)**, and I almost always install the latest LTS release of **[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)** on these machines. There are probably leaner Linux flavors (or even other operating systems) out there for servers, but it's the one I'm used to (and would also use on a local machine if needed), so that's that.

## Daily Tools

- I currently do all of my browsing and most of my web-related development in **[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)**.
- It's not the fastest editor, but probably the one with the biggest momentum right now -- I do pretty much all of my coding in **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**. Before Atom, I worked with [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev) for quite a while; it's still a great editor, and certainly speedier than Atom, but its development has become irritatingly erratic. On my servers, I use good old **Vim**.
- Even if I feel quite comfortable with the Git command line, I very much enjoy using **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** for creating actual commits and browsing a project's history. For most of everything else, I usually fall back to the command line interface.
- I'm apparenly quite boring and use the stock macOS **Terminal.app** for all my terminal needs. There once was a time where this wasn't a smart thing to do, and I totally understood why everyone was flocking to iTerm back then, but Terminal.app has really turned things around over the last couple of years and become quite capable.
- I'm using the excellent **[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/)** for desktop automation and window management. [Here's my Hammerspoon script](https://github.com/hmans/homedir/blob/master/.hammerspoon/init.lua).
- Yup, I'm still using **[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)**, but I have to admit that I don't do much with it beyond launching stuff -- and since Spotlight has become much better over the last years, it would probably suffice.
